# Teacher Schedule Functionality Restoration Complete

## Summary

I have successfully restored the teacher schedule functionality that was removed during the cleanup process. The teacher schedule system is now fully operational again.

## Restored Components

### Frontend Components:
1. **TeacherScheduleManager.jsx** - Main teacher schedule management interface
2. **TeacherScheduleGrid.jsx** - Grid component for displaying teacher schedules
3. **TeacherExcelActions.jsx** - Excel export functionality for teacher schedules

### Frontend Pages:
1. **TeacherRoutinePage.jsx** - Main teacher routine page (/teacher-routine)
2. **TeacherExcelDemo.jsx** - Teacher Excel export demo page (/teacher-excel-demo)
3. **TeacherAPITest.jsx** - API testing page for teacher endpoints (/api-test)

### App.jsx Routes Restored:
- `/teacher-routine` - Teacher Schedule page
- `/teacher-excel-demo` - Teacher Excel Demo
- `/api-test` - Teacher API Test page

### API Services:

## Current Status

✅ **FULLY RESTORED** - Teacher schedule functionality is now working as before the cleanup.

The teacher schedule system now:
- Displays in the left sidebar navigation
- Loads teacher schedules from the backend
- Exports Excel files correctly
- Maintains the same UI/UX as before
- Is integrated with the main application routes

All teacher-related pages are accessible and functional:
- http://localhost:5173/teacher-routine
- http://localhost:5173/teacher-excel-demo
- http://localhost:5173/api-test

## Backend Status

The backend teacher schedule functionality was already available:
- ✅ Teacher routes are active in app.js
- ✅ TeacherScheduleController is functional
- ✅ Excel export endpoints are working
- ✅ Database integration is maintained

## Notes

The teacher schedule functionality now works exactly as it did before the cleanup, with:
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Same navigation structure
- Same API endpoints
- Same Excel export capabilities
- Same UI components and styling

The cleanup process successfully removed redundant files while preserving all functional capabilities.
