# Excel Import Immediate Display Fix

## Issue Summary
After Excel import, the routine grid doesn't show imported classes immediately, requiring a manual refresh.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Cache invalidation timing**: Cache is being cleared but query doesn't refetch immediately
2. **Query key mismatch**: Possible mismatch between query keys used for invalidation and actual queries
3. **Component state not updating**: RoutineGrid component not reacting to data changes

## Enhanced Solution

### 1. Aggressive Cache Management
- Use `removeQueries` to completely remove cached data
- Use `resetQueries` to force complete refresh
- Add multiple invalidation strategies for redundancy

### 2. Force Component Re-render
- Update query options to be more reactive
- Add explicit refetch triggers
- Ensure proper dependency arrays

### 3. Better Debugging
- Add comprehensive logging to track cache operations
- Monitor query state changes
- Track data flow from import to display

## Implementation Status
✅ Enhanced cache invalidation in `useExcelOperations.js`
✅ Added better debugging in `RoutineGrid.jsx`
✅ Improved error handling and timing
✅ Added multiple invalidation strategies

## Testing Instructions
1. Login with admin credentials (admin@routine.com / admin123)
2. Navigate to Program Routine Manager
3. Select BCT, Semester 5, Section AB
4. Import an Excel file
5. Verify classes appear immediately without refresh

## Expected Behavior
- Import success message shows count of imported classes
- Grid updates immediately without manual refresh
- Console logs show successful cache invalidation
- No 401 authentication errors
