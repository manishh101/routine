### Individual Delete Operations:
- **🎯 Individual delete buttons** - Small, circular delete buttons on each class cell
- **🔒 Rich confirmation dialogs** - Show class details (subject, teacher, room, time)
- **🔄 Multi-period support** - Intelligent handling of spanned classes
- **✨ Visual feedback** - Hover effects, loading states, and smooth animations
- **🛡️ Error handling** - Comprehensive error messages with user-friendly descriptions
- **🔌 API integration** - Full support for clearClass and clearSpanGroup operations
- **♿ Accessibility** - ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support

### User Experience Benefits:
- **🎯 Precise Control** - Users can delete exactly what they want
- **🛡️ Safety First** - No risk of accidental bulk deletion
- **📝 Clear Feedback** - Rich confirmation dialogs with all relevant details
- **🔄 Smart Handling** - Multi-period classes are handled as single units
- **⚡ Performance** - Optimized mutations with cache updates

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Removed Components:
```jsx
// ❌ REMOVED: Dangerous bulk delete functionality
- "Clear All" button in routine grid header
- handleClearAllClasses function (60+ lines)
- Ctrl+Delete keyboard shortcut for bulk deletion
- ClearOutlined and ExclamationCircleOutlined icons
- Bulk delete confirmation modal
```

### Maintained Components:
```jsx
// ✅ KEPT: Safe individual delete functionality
- Individual delete buttons on each class cell
- handleClearClass function for single/multi-period deletion
- Rich confirmation modals with class details
- clearClassMutation and clearSpanGroupMutation
- Professional styling with hover effects
- Comprehensive error handling
```

### API Endpoints:
```javascript
// ✅ WORKING: All delete endpoints functional
routinesAPI.clearClass(programCode, semester, section, { dayIndex, slotIndex })
routinesAPI.clearSpanGroup(spanId)
```

### After (Safe):
- ✅ Only individual class deletions possible
- ✅ Each deletion requires explicit confirmation
- ✅ Rich context shown before deletion
- ✅ Granular control over what gets deleted
- ✅ Multi-period classes handled intelligently
- ✅ No risk of accidental bulk deletion
