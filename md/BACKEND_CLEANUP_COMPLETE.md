#### **Utils:**
- ✅ `utils/scheduleGeneration.js` - Disabled teacher functionality (38 lines)

#### **Directories:**
- ✅ `examples/` - Entire directory with RabbitMQ examples (192 lines)

### 🔧 **Files Fixed and Cleaned:**

#### **Security Fixes:**
- ✅ `config/db.js` - **SECURITY**: Removed hardcoded MongoDB credentials
  - Removed fallback URI with exposed username/password
  - Now requires proper environment variables
  - Added proper error handling for missing credentials

#### **Import Cleanup:**
- ✅ `app.js` - Removed references to deleted schedules routes
- ✅ `scripts/seed.js` - Cleaned up TeacherSchedule imports and calls
- ✅ `worker.js` - **COMPLETE REWRITE**: Disabled teacher functionality
  - Converted from 270+ lines to 114 clean lines
  - Now gracefully handles queue messages but acknowledges as disabled
  - Maintains backward compatibility for function calls

## 📈 **Total Cleanup Impact**

### **Quantitative Results:**
- **9 files removed** from backend
- **1 directory removed** (examples/)
- **~800+ lines** of unused/redundant code eliminated
- **1 critical security vulnerability** fixed (hardcoded credentials)
- **Zero breaking changes** to working functionality

### **Files Before vs After:**
- **Before**: 56 backend JavaScript files
- **After**: 47 backend JavaScript files  
- **Reduction**: 16% fewer files

## ✅ **What Was Cleaned**

### **1. Disabled Teacher Functionality:**
- Removed all teacher schedule generation code
- Cleaned up worker service (disabled but maintains compatibility)
- Removed unused models and controllers
- Updated imports and references throughout codebase

### **2. Security Improvements:**
- Removed hardcoded MongoDB credentials from config
- Enforced proper environment variable usage
- Added validation for missing environment variables

### **3. Code Quality:**
- Removed duplicate admin creation scripts
- Removed test/example files not needed in production
- Cleaned up unused imports and dead code
- Simplified worker service while maintaining queue compatibility

### **4. Architecture Cleanup:**
- Maintained clean separation of concerns
- Kept essential functionality intact
- Removed redundant route definitions
- Cleaned up app.js endpoint listings

## 🏗️ **Current Clean Architecture**

### **Essential Controllers (11 controllers):**
- ✅ `authController.js` - Authentication
- ✅ `programController.js` - Program management  
- ✅ `routineController.js` - Core routine functionality
- ✅ `updateRoutineController.js` - Routine updates
- ✅ `teacherController.js` - Teacher management
- ✅ `teacherScheduleController.js` - Teacher schedule export
- ✅ `subjectController.js` - Subject management
- ✅ `roomController.js` - Room management
- ✅ `userController.js` - User management
- ✅ `programSemesterController.js` - Program semester management
- ✅ `timeSlotDefinitionController.js` - Time slot management

### **Essential Models (8 models):**
- ✅ `User.js` - User authentication
- ✅ `Teacher.js` - Teacher information
- ✅ `Subject.js` - Subject definitions
- ✅ `Room.js` - Room information  
- ✅ `Program.js` - Program definitions
- ✅ `ProgramSemester.js` - Program semester structure
- ✅ `RoutineSlot.js` - **Single source of truth** for routine data
- ✅ `TimeSlot.js` - Time slot definitions

### **Essential Services (2 services):**
- ✅ `queue.service.js` - High-level queue operations
- ✅ `rabbitmq.service.js` - Low-level RabbitMQ operations

### **Essential Utils (4 utilities):**
- ✅ `conflictDetection.js` - Scheduling conflict detection
- ✅ `excelGeneration.js` - Excel export functionality
- ✅ `excelTemplate.js` - Excel template generation
- ✅ `validation.js` - Data validation utilities

## 🔍 **Verification Results**

### **✅ No Broken Dependencies:**
- All imports properly updated
- No references to removed files
- Application starts without errors
- All routes properly mapped

### **✅ Security Enhanced:**
- No hardcoded credentials in codebase
- Proper environment variable validation
- Secure configuration enforced

### **✅ Functionality Preserved:**
- All core routine management works
- Excel import/export functionality intact
- User authentication and authorization working
- Teacher management (without automatic scheduling) working
- Database operations fully functional

## 🎯 **Benefits Achieved**

### **1. Security:**
