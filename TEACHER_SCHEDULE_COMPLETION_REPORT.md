├── TeacherScheduleManager.jsx     # Main teacher schedule component with modern UI
├── TeacherScheduleGrid.jsx        # Grid component for displaying teacher schedules  
└── TeacherExcelActions.jsx        # Excel export functionality for teacher schedules

├── TeacherExcelDemo.jsx           # Teacher Excel demo page
└── TeacherAPITest.jsx             # API testing page for teacher endpoints
```

### Modified Files
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Restored teacher route imports and route definitions
- `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Added teacher API methods with proper error handling
- `frontend/src/components/Layout.jsx` - Verified teacher menu items are present

## 🔄 Data Transformation Logic

The system handles the format difference between teacher schedule API and routine grid:

**Teacher API Format:**
```javascript
{
  data: {
    schedule: {
      "0": [array_of_classes],  // Sunday
      "1": [array_of_classes],  // Monday
      // etc.
    }
  }
}
```

**Routine Grid Expected Format:**
```javascript
{
  "0": {                    // Sunday
    "slotIndex": class_object,
    "slotIndex": class_object,
    // etc.
  },
  "1": {                    // Monday
    // etc.
  }
}
```

**Transformation Implementation:**
- Converts array format to object format using `slotIndex` as keys
- Preserves all class information (subject, room, time, program details)
- Integrates with fetched time slots for proper display
- Maintains real-time updates and statistics

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Header Section
- **Gradient Background**: Professional purple gradient with glass-morphism
- **Typography**: Modern font hierarchy with proper spacing
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### Statistics Cards
- **Real-time Data**: Live calculation of classes, subjects, active days, hours
- **Color Coding**: Each statistic has unique color and icon
- **Professional Layout**: Card-based design with shadows and borders

### Teacher Selection
- **Enhanced Dropdown**: Search functionality with department information
- **Professional Styling**: Consistent with overall design system
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and error handling

### Schedule Grid

- **Professional Display**: Clean layout with proper spacing and colors
- **Responsive**: Works on various screen sizes

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### React Query Integration
```javascript
// Teacher data fetching
const { data: teachersData } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['teachers'],
  queryFn: () => teachersAPI.getAllTeachers(),
  staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
});

// Teacher schedule fetching with auto-refresh
const { data: scheduleData } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['teacher-schedule', selectedTeacher],
  queryFn: () => teachersAPI.getTeacherSchedule(selectedTeacher),
  enabled: !!selectedTeacher,
  staleTime: 1 * 60 * 1000,
  refetchInterval: 2 * 60 * 1000,
});

// Time slots fetching
const { data: timeSlotsData } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['timeSlots'],
  queryFn: () => timeSlotsAPI.getTimeSlots(),
  staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
});
```

### Data Transformation Logic
```javascript
const transformedScheduleData = React.useMemo(() => {
  if (!schedule.schedule || !timeSlots.length) return null;

  const routine = {};
  // Initialize routine object for all days
  for (let day = 0; day <= 6; day++) {
    routine[day] = {};
  }

  // Convert teacher schedule array format to routine object format
  Object.entries(schedule.schedule).forEach(([dayIndex, daySchedule]) => {
    if (Array.isArray(daySchedule)) {
      daySchedule.forEach(classInfo => {
        if (classInfo.slotIndex) {
          routine[dayIndex][classInfo.slotIndex] = {
            // Transform class data to routine format
            _id: classInfo._id,
            subjectName: classInfo.subjectName_display,
            // ... other properties
          };
        }
      });
    }
  });

  return { data: { routine, timeSlots } };
}, [schedule.schedule, selectedTeacher, selectedTeacherInfo, timeSlots]);
```
